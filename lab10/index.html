        <h1>Jackelyn Cach's Biography </h1> 
    

    <a id="content"></a>
        <p>
            My name is Jackelyn Cach. I am currently a senior at Syracuse University majoring in Information Management and Technology with a concentration of Web Design and Management.<br> 
            The iSchool has allowed me to find courses such as Data in Society, Social Media in the Organization, Introduction to Web Development, and much more! These courses allowed me to have these interests <br>
            and being able to learn much more revolving these topics. One major accomplishment is that I have been part of the iSchoolâ€™s Dean List for outstanding academic achievement in obtaining over a 3.5 GPA.<br>
            Another accomplishment is being a published author. Thanks to the <strong>iSchool Inclusion Institute (i3)</strong> where I obtained and advanced my research skills, my team and I were able to get published by the iConference.<br> 
            These are only a few accomplishments that I would like to highlight. There are more yet to come when entering the workforce!
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>

        <p>
        Aside from school, I enjoy a variety of hobbies. I enjoy reading, listening to music, and watching TV shows. I enjoy reading books that will help me in the future, right now I am currently reading a book on how <br>
        to hopefully become financially steadily in my 20s. So far it has been an interesting read! I love to listen to many genres of music, but my absolute favorite is Latin music.
        </p>

        To be more specific these are a few things that I enjoy more than what I mentioned previously: 
        <ul>
            <li>drinking coffee</li>
            <li>listening to podcasts</li>
            <li>learning how to bake</li>
        </ul>
