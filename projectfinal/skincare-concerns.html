            <h2>Types of Skincare Concerns</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Acne:</strong>Acne occurs when hair follicles are plugged with oil and/or dead skin cells. Acne causes the 
                development of whiteheads, blackheads, and/or pimples. The development of acne is common between teenagers and young 
                adults. 
                <br>
                The causes of acne are the following: excess oil production, hair follicles clogged by oil and/or dead skin cells, 
                bacteria, and inflammation.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                <strong>Acne Scars:</strong>Acne scars are textural changes that occur on the skin because of acne. Acne scars can 
                appear on the face as damage to the individual’s skin texture. The causes of acne scars are the following: destroyed 
                skin tissue that is not regenerated during the skin’s healing process of acne. 
            </p>

            <br>

                <strong>Dark Spots:</strong> Dark spot can be known also as skin age spots or sunspots. What causes dark spots is 
                that the skin produces more melanin than normal in certain areas of the skin. Dark spots can range from light brown 
                to dark brown depending on the individual’s skin. 

            <br>
                A few more causes of dark spots are the following: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Sun Damage</li>
                    <li>Hormonal Changes</li>
                    <li>Medication Side Effects</li>
                    <li>Inflammation</li>
                    <li>Irritation</li>
                </ul> 

            <br>

            <p>
                <strong>Uneven Texture:</strong> Uneven skin texture is the most common result of excess dead skin cells on the 
                surface of the skin. Skin texture is about the look and the feel of the skin's surface. When there is uneven skin
                texture, it can feel rough, dry, and not enough care for the skin.
            </p>
                <br>
                The individual’s environment plays a significant role in their skin texture due to the following: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Sun Exposure</li>
                    <li>Pollution</li>
                    <li>Air</li>
                    <li>Dirt</li>
                    <li>Chemicals</li>
                    <li>Aging</li>
                    <li>and the list goes on</li>
                </ul>
