            <p>
                There are a range of skincare brands that advertise for these skincare concerns: acne, acne scars, dark spots, 
                uneven texture and much more. 
                <br>
                It always comes with the question of which skincare brand or products should I choose?

            <h2>The College Student Dilemma</h2>

            <p>
                As a college student, it is hard to invest in skincare that is great for you. Often there are skincare 
                brands that are in the affordable to high-end. As my target is for college students to young adults, 
                I want to introduce two affordable skincare brands that will not hurt your pocket. These two skincare 
                brands offer affordable skin care products that you can create a whole skincare routine. A skincare routine 
                can consist of the following: cleanser, toner, serum, eye moisturizer, and face moisturizer. 
            </p>

            <h3> Skincare Brands</h3>

            <p>
                The brands are the INKEY List and The Ordinary. These are brands that I have previously tried and liked. 
                I prefer the INKEY List a bit more, as you will see in another page that I incorporated a few of their 
                products into my skincare routine. I would like to share these brands because they provide results and 
                can create a whole skincare routine with a little over $50. High-end skincare brands have one product that 
                can cost over $60!
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Here, I will be providing articles that discuss about the INKEY List and The Ordinary products. These articles
                are very important because they go into detail of several products from these brands, and discuss how it will help
                the skin. At first I was planning on showing only two products, but it would be doing a disservice in showing what
                other amazing products they have at affordable prices! 
            </p>

            <br>


                Here are two articles that discuss more about the two brand's products:

                        Glamour goes into detail about the INKEY List brand and their products. Glamour goes into detail of 13 
                        of the brand's products and discuss how it is good for various and/or certain skin types. It gives a 
                        photo of each product, price point, and a description of the ingredients in the product and what it is 
                        used for.

                        Similar to Glamour, Allure reviews about 17 products from The Ordinary. Allure discusses how the brand
                        is budget-friendly, and has great products for various and/or certain skin types. It gives a photo of 
                        each product, price point, and a description of the ingredients in the product and what it is used for.

                Take a look at these two articles to learn more about the products that they discuss! I believe that these 
                articles will encourage you purchase any of these products without the worry of breaking the bank!
