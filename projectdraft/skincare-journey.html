        <h1>My Skincare Journey</h1>

            <p>
                I wanted to share my skincare journey and the products that I have found to helpful to help clear 
                my acne, acne scars, and dark spots. To find the products that work for me, it was all about researching 
                what skin type I have, trial and error of using skincare products, and taking note of the progress that 
                my skin was making. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I want to share that investing in your skin is a form of self-care. It does not need to be extremely 
                high-end products, but as long as you find skincare products that work for your skin type, that is 
                all that matters! I encourage you to find what works for you! 
            </p>

                Below you will find pictures of the products that I use. These products are a mix of affordable to a 
                bit high end products. These are products that I use for my morning and nighttime skincare routine. 
                Some of these products I use specifically for my morning or nighttime routine.

            <h2>My Skincare Morning and Night Routine</h2>

            <p>
                This is what I apply in the morning in this order: 
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>The INKEY List’s Salicylic Acid Cleanser</li>
                <li>Dior’s Hydra Life Micellar Milk No Rinse Cleanser</li>
                <li>Dior’s Hydra Life Pores Away Pink Clay Mask (twice or three times a week)</li>
                <li>TONYMOLY Poresol Ampoule Serum</li>
                <li>The INKEY List’s Caffeine Eye Cream</li>
                <li>Dior’s Hydra Life Fresh Hydration Sorbet Crème</li>
                <li>Bio-Oil’s Skincare Oil</li>
            </ol>

            <br>

            <p>
                This is what I apply in the night in this order:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>The INKEY List’s Salicylic Acid Cleanser</li>
                <li>Dior’s Hydra Life Micellar Milk No Rinse Cleanser</li>
                <li>TONYMOLY Poresol Ampoule Serum</li>
                <li>The INKEY List’s Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA) Serum*</li>
                <li>The INKEY List’s Retinol Cream *</li>
                <li>The INKEY List’s Caffeine Eye Cream</li>
                <li>Dior’s Hydra Life Fresh Hydration Sorbet Crème</li>
                <li>Bio-Oil’s Skincare Oil</li>
                <li>LANEIGE’s Berry Lip Sleeping Mask</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                *Note: These are products that I use every other night. The reason for this is because you cannot combine 
                these two together because it will give a negative reaction to your skin. It is safer to use these products
                on separate nights. I use the retinol cream two to three times a week because my skin is still on the younger
                side to be using retinol cream every night.
